# Boilerplate for Node.js üõ°Ô∏è

The sample is copied from ['Bulletproof node.js project architecture'](https://github.com/santiq/bulletproof-nodejs)

In this repo I have removed some of the additional things that I don't think should be part of boilerplate app.

## Development

We use `node` version `14.15.3`

```
nvm install 14.15.3
```

```
nvm use 14.15.3
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run start
```

It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
